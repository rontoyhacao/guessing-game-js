# guessing-game-js

Guessing Game is a short simple project I had from "The Complete JavaScript Course 2021" by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy.

This project is about putting all the fundamentals into action from declaring variables to converting into DRY code through functions. This gave me a really great head start to my JavaScript learning journey.
